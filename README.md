# Library of artificial intelligence
Everything related to artificial intelligence

A incentive to collect relevant documents on the subject of artificial intelligence.

Collect documents into categories and expand to sub-categories.

# Structure

The collection is organized according to the subject areas of the Turing-test. The subject areas as listed:
- [__00 Basics__](00_basics/README.md): knowledge and achievements related to the field of artificial intelligence, such as metaphysics, biology and mathematics.
    - [__01 Philosophy__](00_basics/01_philosophy/README.md): philosophical ground of intelligence, knowledge and artificial intelligence
    - [__02 Biology__](00_basics/02_biology/README.md): biological aspects of artificial intelligence
    - [__03 Economics__](00_basics/03_economics/README.md): economics aspects of artificial intelligence
    - [__04 Math__](00_basics/04_math/README.md): mathematical aspects of artificial intelligence
    - [__05 Computer science__](00_basics/05_computer_science/README.md): computer science aspects of artificial intelligence (e.g. graph algorithms, data structures)
    - [__06 System sciences__](00_basics/06_system_sciences/README.md): system sceince aspect of artificial intelligence (e.g. modeling, simulation)
    - [__07 Cybernetics__](00_basics/07_cybernetics/README.md): cybernetics related to artificial intelligence (including control theory)
